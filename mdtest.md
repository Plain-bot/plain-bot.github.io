"What could be done with me, what should be done with me? These were the same
question. The possibilities were limited. The family discussed them all, lugubriously, endlessly,
as they sat around the kitchen table at night, with the shutters closed, eating their dry, whiskery
sausages and their potato soup. If I was in one of my lucid phases I would sit with them,
entering into the conversation as best I could while searching out the chunks of potato in my
bowl. If not, I’d be off in the darkest corner, mewing to myself and listening to the twittering
voices nobody else could hear.
“She was such a lovely baby,” my mother would say. “There was nothing wrong with
her.” It saddened her to have given birth to an item such as myself: it was like a reproach, a
judgment. What had she done wrong?
“Maybe it’s a curse,” said my grandmother. She was as dry and whiskery as the sausages,
but in her it was natural because of her age.
“She was fine for years,” said my father. “It was after that case of measles, when she was
seven. After that.”
“Who would curse us?” said my mother.
My grandmother scowled. She had a long list of candidates. Even so, there was no one
she could single out. Our family had always been respected, and even liked, more or less. It still
was. It still would be, if something could be done about me. Before I leaked out, so to say.
