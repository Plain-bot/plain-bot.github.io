Sourc code to [The Trash Ting](https://plainsys.github.io/)

Just a basic website I made because... I was bored, what else can I say.

<p align="center"><h1>Terms ig</h1></p>

*For those who are here just to view the site then ignore this but for those who wanna do stuff with it.*

So basiclly... You can do whatever you want with it. Look at the code, download the repo, fork the repo, mod the site (idk why) whatever.

However if you do decide to reupload or clone or do whatever with the site. I do ask that you at least add more to it and not
remove text and change the properties and say "its yours". Yeah please don't claim this as your own... you could probably make
a better site then this lol.

... Thats pretty much it lol, enjoy
