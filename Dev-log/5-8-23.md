# Starting fresh I guess

I used to have some old blogger account or something where I had like two posts... I'm going to use this from
now on. So i'm going to use this to report development on my new game and HOPEFULLY, update this daily. Also I will
keep this link hidden for awhile so.

Say hi to Bob... a random enemy I made for testing purposes. He's super cool and super awesome and super based. Anyways yeah, not
much to show other then an enemy that will deal damage if you touch it. Also the "H: 100" thing is another testing thing to see
if the health text would change or not. This will def be removed in future versions and the final release. 

# KEYCARDS!!! REAL

![secret keycard](https://github.com/PlainSys/plainsys.github.io/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202023-05-08%20193038.png?raw=true)

A new addition (kind of) is keycards, they will be scattered across the stage and if you find one and use it on a door, it will open.
Some keycard doors will also be used for secrets so be on the lookout for that I guess.

# Thats it...

And that pretty much wraps up the first dev log (technically third). I might update this, might not.
